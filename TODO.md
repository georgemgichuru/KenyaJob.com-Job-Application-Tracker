- The current implementation uses generic CSS selectors that may need adjustment based on KenyaJob.com's actual HTML structure
- ChromeDriver is required and should be in your PATH
- Internet connection is required for web scraping
- Respect website's robots.txt and terms of service
- Consider adding delays between requests to avoid overloading the server
